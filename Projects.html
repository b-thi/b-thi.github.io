                     This is our entry into the 2020 SSC case study competition. We predict the hourly residential electricity demand in Ontario by
                     augmenting the provided dataset with publicly available data (such
                     as zonal electric demand and population data). An Autoregressive
                     (AR) model is used to provide accurate hourly predictions aggregated
                     across sectors, while various signal separation techniques are used to
                     provide insight into the proportion of electricity usage at each hour
                     that is associated with the residential sector. Our model produces
                     results that are in line with our expectations of the residential sector.                  </p>

                     We introduce a methodology for integrating functional data into densely connected feed-forward neural networks. The model is defined for scalar responses with at least one functional covariate and some number of scalar covariates. A by-product of the method is a set of functional parameters that are dynamic to the learning process which leads to interpretability. The model is shown to perform well in a number of contexts including prediction of new data and recovery of the true underlying coefficient function; these results were confirmed through cross-validations and simulation studies. A collection of useful functions are built on top of the Keras/Tensorflow architecture allowing for general use of the approach. Note: previously titled 'Functional Neural Networks'.

                     This is an introduction which includes the foundation for this view of neural networks. The authors (Ricky T. Q. Chen, Yulia Rubanova, Jesse Bettencourt, David Duvenaud) had the insight that the usual neural network approach was essentially using Euler's method to work through its layers. They take a step back in this process and move forward in a different direction using more sophisticated approaches that, in some sense, allow for an infinite number of layers.

                     The goal was to provide useful information to a particular police department so that they can better protect the community. We developed an original method that combined functional data analysis and time series models to predict weekly proportions of crime priority levels. The model resulted in very low error rates for weekly predictions. This information can then guide the city of Baltimore in allocating emergency personnel and Police officers efficiently between precincts.

                     We looked to solve an optimization problem that some schools around B.C will inevitably face
                     with the advent of a "walking school bus" program. The problem is how to optimize travel
                     routes while also trying to efficiently cluster children together that will be a part of each of
                     these routes. We implemented a combination of a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
                     incorporated in an optimization strategy that used the Google’s API to find optimal travel
                     distances. This project was expanded upon by one of the members and won an OR competition.

                     This was a Statistics Canada research problem that I solved; the final result was a non-parametric model that helped identify duplicates through frequency of use of "key words" in the data set. In particular, the model took advantage of Zipf's Law which conjectures that the distributions of many types of data can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. Over 100,000 duplicates were discovered in a data set of over 21 million observations.

                      Our work utilizes athletic testing data from soccer Combine events. For athletes that did not complete in all events, absent data is rectified through missing forest imputation. A scoring system is then developed that uses the best performances of each athlete across all of their tests. An athlete’s score is then determined to be a weighted combination of their best performances, in which weights are derived through the use of gradient descent.

                     looked for a causal connection between how religious a family is and how
                     much money they make. More details will be provided below however, as
                     an overview, it was found that families that earn more also tend to go to
